# Type Checking

To help identify and prevent errors, all code blocks are type-checked. This is done using the TypeScript compiler based on the `tsconfig.json` file local to the project that MDXTS is running in.

## Allowing errors

If you want to allow errors for a specific code block, you can add an `allowErrors` prop to the code block meta field:

````mdx
```tsx allowErrors
const a: string = 1
```
````

```tsx allowErrors
const a: string = 1
```

This prevents the code block from erroring when the project is type-checked and removes the error indicator and message from the rendered code block.

### Allowing specific errors

To allow specific errors, add the `allowErrors` prop with a comma separated list of error codes:

````mdx
```tsx allowErrors="2322"
const a: string = 1
```
````

This is useful for educational purposes when you want to show the error message to the user. Note, the error number can be found in the error message.
